## Movie Trailer Website


This project builds a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers. The code stores a list of movie titles, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. This information is displayed on a web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.


This website contains 3 *Python* version 2.7.9 files that store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website.


The **Movie Class** in the *media.py* module creates a data structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title,  poster URL and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.


The *entertainment_center.py* file creates multiple instances of that **Movie Class** to represent your favorite movies and groups all the instances together in a list.


The Python module named *fresh_tomatoes.py* has a function called *open_movies_page* that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an **HTML** file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
